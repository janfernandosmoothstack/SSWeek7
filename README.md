# Coding Challenge
The objective of this exercise was to learn Javascript and implement pagination. This web application contained a table of books and listed 6 books per page and used the number of books stored to calculate how many pages were needed. I learned how to code using Javascript and create a simple UI using HTML and CSS.

# Node.js LMS
The objective of this exercise was to learn how to use Node.js. I used it to define the API's and the database connection for the Library Management System application in which I had previously used Springboot. This is the backend of the LMS application, and I used React to implement the frontend.

# React JS LMS
The objective of this project was to implement a section of the Library Management System in React JS to make it a web application that the user can interact with online. Through this process I learned how to use React JS with the Flux pattern to create a simple web application. All requests made from this application were sent to the Node.js application.
